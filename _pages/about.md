I am currently a senior undergraduate at [SJTU](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) expected to graduate in 2024.

I am also working as a backend development intern for routing system with SD-RTN(Software Defined Realtime Transport Network) Team at [ByteDance](https://www.bytedance.com/en)

Prior to studies at SJTU, I spent several memorable years learning finance and economics at [GSM](https://en.gsm.pku.edu.cn/) with the aim of understanding how our society operates.

Now I am seeking to further my education in the broad field of computer systems as well as accumulate experience as a general software engineer.
