I am currently a senior undergraduate at [SJTU](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) expected to graduate in 2024. Check my tech [resume](https://sylvansun.github.io/assets/pdf/resume.pdf) here.

I am working as a backend development intern for TikTok Internatioinal E-commerce Tax Group.

I previously worked as a backend development intern for routing system with SD-RTN(Software Defined Realtime Transport Network) Team at [ByteDance](https://www.bytedance.com/en).

Prior to studies at SJTU, I spent several memorable years learning finance and economics at [GSM](https://en.gsm.pku.edu.cn/) with the aim of understanding how our society operates. Check this page for my [scholarship](https://www.gsm.pku.edu.cn/undergraduate/info/1021/6039.htm) there.

Now I am seeking to further my education in the broad field of computer science as well as accumulate experience for career as a general software engineer.
