<p>无论是作为打发时间的手段也好，还是将其视作一种对自我心理愈疗的方式，或者是仅仅想把自己的思维实体化记录下来。将来或许不会再翻看，但成段落的文字总比碎片化的思绪要好上很多。写的东西未必客观，也未必正确，更未必对自己内心世界毫无保留。但个人能保证这些文字一定都是百分之百真实不加粉饰的，也就是说，写出来的，是我此时此刻完全真实的想法。</p> <hr/> <h2

<p>很多朋友喜欢拍照，旅游至某地，为记录风景，或者打卡自己曾到此处，对镜头粲然一笑，或留下深沉背影。交付朋友圈打造人设，发送一二好友分享情绪，或者留存相册珍藏。我一直不觉得这种行为俗气——人如果不做些什么来记录自己的生活，多年之后，青春又付何人说？不过，我确实比较少留下自己的照片。可能是觉得自己不够上相，或者是在过去的人生里伤神痛苦多于欢乐，总之相册中并没留有太多自己的痕迹。如今我却突然发现，写作和拍照在记录生活这一点上是有着共同的功效的。譬如小学生看图写话，我大可把生活中的某个时刻用文字记录下来。可以是一张照片，可以是一段视频。</p> <h4 id="写作可以把不同模态的感触融合在一起">写作可以把不同模态的感触融合在一起</h4> <p>去年九月我抵达洛杉矶，其时已经深陷抑郁的沼泽，但还并没有开始服药，痛苦大概占据我清醒时间的百分之九十九。朋友（s）在北美已经读博两年，作为老留子和东道主，自然承担起带我“探图”的任务，于是s、他女朋友（l）、我们三人相伴出行。我并没有把自己病重的事告诉他们，首先是因为难为情——抑郁症当然并不是什么光彩的值得言说的事情；其次也是因为不想坏了人家的好心情，恋人相伴出行而愿意带上我，自然是把我当作朋友，做朋友很重要的一件事就是不要扫兴。故而我只能佯装快乐，尽量不让自己的状态被人看出来。</p> <p>当然，假装的快乐并不能掩盖内心的痛苦，虚假的笑容再怎么伪饰大概也是扭曲的吧。l问想听什么歌，我整个大脑一半是痛苦的，一半是麻木的，只好托辞不知道。“就随便听点儿你常听的吧。”于是一曲轻快的旋律在车内悠然响起。在那一瞬，我突然感觉内心有什么东西被击中了——让我从不可言说的痛苦中暂时回到现实。恍惚间我感受到了久违的快乐，坐在一辆老旧而散发有香甜气息的二手车中，眼前是纵横交错的洛城交通网络，金色的阳光洒在前排二人的肩上，s晒得健康的双手握紧了方向盘……l接着问我们，觉得这首歌是忧伤的还是快乐的，</p>

The movie is worth watching for the action scenes alone, yet I was a little bit unsatisfied with their arrangement of Ilsa’s ending. More precisely, I convinced myself to calm down with the hope of her death as an approach of deceiving the artificial intelligence. Should her death become a reality, I will definitely be furious.</p> <p>Getting back to the point, when asked about your film-viewing experience about an MI series movie, one’s impressions are typically classified into two categories: scene and plot. Considering that almost a month has passed since I watched the movie, the remaining memories are impressive and worth discussion.</p> <h2 id="plots">Plots</h2> <h3 id="the-tightly-knit-mi-trio">The tightly knit MI trio</h3> <p>The footage is well distributed among the actors, with Ethan being the point man, Luther the reliable technician, and Benji the comic relief. The trio is a well-oiled machine, with each member playing their part to perfection. For me one of the most important driver that keeps me coming back to the theater over and over again is the chemistry between the three. I always treasure friendship and the interpretation of camaraderie in MI series is way better than that in other movies of the same genre(no offense).</p> <p>Ever since they arranged the plot of Ethan saving Benji at the risk of giving huge amount of untracable money to Lane at the end of MI:5 and Ethan saving Luther with the danger of lossing the plutonium at the start of MI:6, I have known that no crisis can make them turn their backs on each other. Should there be any substitution of any single member of the team, I will not buy it. With this premise in mind, my doubt about Ilsa’s ending arose quite naturally.</p> <h3 id="ilsas-endingperhaps">Ilsa’s ending(perhaps?)</h3> <p>Frankly speaking, I did not expect that Ilsa would die at all when Gabriel announced that one of Ilsa and Grace would be killed so that the chance of him acquiring the key would be the highest under the prediction of AI. After all, we are talking about the female agent who was capable of carrying out the task of undercover with Lane and slained Vinter, the Bone Doctor alone. The scene on the bridge where Ilsa faught Gabriel was illogical with Ilsa holding a long sword and Gabriel holding only a small dagger. The movie did spend a lot of footage laying out Gabriel’s capabilities, yet Ilsa’s failure with her signature move was also illoogical because sword should have a natural advantage over a dagger.</p> <p>It’s not that I do not accept her death, it’s just that I am not satisfied with the way it happened. Even if they are going to let her die anyway as a result of Rebecca’s schedule, they could have made her death more dignified. I’m not saying that sacraficing herself for Grace’s survival is not worth it, it’s just the way they present it too scribbly. She could have died more heroically and the teammates could have shown more grief for her death.</p> <h3 id="the-introduction-of-peggy-carter-to-the-crew">The introduction of <em>Peggy Carter</em> to the crew</h3> <p>Talking about the replacement of Ilsa with Grace, our beloved Peggy Carter(Hayley Atwell’s role in Marvel Universe) was actually a good addition to the team from my perspective. The transformation of her character’s personality, though not perfectly smooth, was well articulated and it increased my expectations for her part in the upcoming Part 2.</p> <h3 id="the-formidable-ai">The formidable AI</h3> <p>I understand and awe the probabilistic model of artificial intelligence. By following its instructions and always taking the action which makes your desired result most likely, Gabriel could have been the most terrifying terrorist in this series. But AI is not unbreakable because any probabilistic prediction has the chance of not reflecting the actual result. I’m a little concerned because the movie did not do a good job of showing what the AI was capable of. Since nowadays almost everybody is familiar with the concept of AI, an ambiguous description of the AI might have been inadequate.</p> <h2 id="scenes">Scenes</h2> <h3 id="you-can-always-count-on-a-speeding-train">You can always count on a speeding train</h3> <p>What most people really like about a speeding train as the site for the grand finale is its relative closedness, isolation and high thrill, where the isolation makes it difficult to get support and the speed adds to the excitement. What’s more, the audience are able to enjoy more landscape as the train moving forward(towards uncertainty).</p> <h3 id="motorcycle-ride-off-a-cliff">Motorcycle ride off a cliff</h3> <p>Although intended as a selling point in the trailer, the actual visual perception of this scene is not comparable with the HALO jumping scene or freehand climbing <em>Burj Khalifa</em> tower scene in the previous movies. And perhaps because I did not chose the theater carefully(I casually chose a cinema where I worked without doing research) the fighting scene with Gabriel was also not comparable with that with Walker on the edge of a cliff.</p> <h3 id="the-poisonous-gas-bomb">The <em>poisonous</em> gas bomb</h3> <p>You remember the explosion of an apparant poisonous bomb filling the conference room with horrifying green gas in the trailer? With expectations of seeing who carried out such an attack and how he managed it but only to find that the man was Ethan and the bomb was merely anaesthetic, I was kind of disappointed for their well-conceived bluffing.</p> <h2 id="expectations-for-part-2">Expectations for Part 2</h2> <p>Upon finishing this blog, I browsed <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Mission_Impossible/">MI subreddit</a> for more discussions about Part 2. To put it simply, some wish Benji had been killed instead of Ilsa, some predict Ilsa would come back in the next movie, some quickly embrace Grace and never care about the bond between Ilsa and Ethan(and the whole team). I am open to any ending of this series and is optimistic about the performance of Grace, but it would be the best if they could let Ilsa back.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="reviews"/><category term="movies"/><category term="spoilers"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[freewheeling movie review on Tom Cruise's latest movie]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">my curriculum vitae</title><link href="https://sylvansun.github.io/blog/2023/resume/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="my curriculum vitae"/><published>2023-07-27T10:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-07-27T10:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://sylvansun.github.io/blog/2023/resume</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://sylvansun.github.io/blog/2023/resume/"><![CDATA[<p>Redirecting to my resume.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[my tech cv generated from chi-cv-template inspired by Alex Chi Z.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Self introduction for GAUnion</title><link href="https://sylvansun.github.io/blog/2023/self-intro-for-gaunion/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Self introduction for GAUnion"/><published>2023-07-12T15:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-07-12T15:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://sylvansun.github.io/blog/2023/self-intro-for-gaunion</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://sylvansun.github.io/blog/2023/self-intro-for-gaunion/"><![CDATA[<h1 id="self-introduction-for-gaunion-2024-recruitment">Self Introduction for GAUnion 2024 recruitment</h1> <h2 id="description">Description</h2> <p>Please write a short essay about yourself. In it, you should emphasize the <strong>distinct qualities</strong> or life experiences of yours which make you a good candidate for GAU and those for higher education abroad. And you would be advised and requested to give concrete and personal examples (Specific anecdotes are particularly welcome) to prove your claim (40%): (Please donot mention your id info, i.e. your name etc., so that the reviewers could evaluate the essay in a more objective manner)</p> <h2 id="essay">Essay</h2> <p>The characteristic treasured most by myself, if required to describe, is the courage of starting something entirely from scratch. Intelligence itself is a keen-edged sword, wielding properly, the owner could break through any obstacles ahead of him. But courage is more like a hammer, clumsy at first glance but the empowerment of which could accompany someone on the long trip of life.</p> <p>My recent wake-up time of life is almost the same time period last year as I am writting this essay this year, when students from my department were required to take the course <em>Lab Practice</em>, from the name of which you could know that it was a course aimed at those who want to conduct research. Unfortunately by that time I was not totally aware of my ability of carrying out research, so blindly choosing a research group and attend their weekly meetings became my only choice that seemed right. However, the experience was not beneficial to me because I could neither gain research inspirations nor accumulate technical skills from my lab. Even though I tried to understand how the research group was able to accomplish their tasks and pushed myself to catch up with the latest progress in the field, I was still not interested in the modern mathematical models of artificial intelligence. At first I thought the problem was not about research itself but my choice of researching field, yet after contacting other professors from systems track I realized that researching itself was not suitable for me whatever topic I chose. Last summer ended up miserable and fruitless and I only finished the course by doing chores.</p> <p>Adversity makes one think. Staring off as a student being encouraged to do scientifical research from the moment entering SJTU, I had not really thought about what it really means to do <strong>research</strong>, and what’s more important, my potentials about it. Yet research is not something that can be done by fleeting enthusiasm, it requires persistent devotions and ceaseless efforts. I realized I was not prepared for life like that and it was time to make some changes.</p> <p>Decision making was always harder. Like I mentioned above, since courage was my strength, I do not hesitate to put my ideas into action once my decision was made. In the field of computer science, one will never lack resources if you make your goals clearly. Starting 2022 Fall Semester, I quitted lab and started preparing for internships after finishing the regular coursework. My progress was slow at first, but better slow than never. Finally I was able to finish those course assignments with minimum effort and accumulated knowledge needed to start as an intern at my current company building their realtime transport network infrastructures. There is still a lot of uncertainty ahead but at least this summer my efforts will not be in vain.</p> <p>My motivation about going abroad for study emerged concurrently last summer as I was doing chores in my lab. Since my burden was not heavy, the fact that I spent a lot of time thinking and planning was imaginable. The original plan, SJTU’s plan for most of its students to be specific, for a student with passable grades like me without careful thinking and consideration was to fulfill Master or PhD degree within SJTU. Yet that route became unsuitable for me last summer because, to be frank, I no longer want to spend any more time on research based on experiences in my lab. Considering the domestic environment and atmosphere of pushing students to do research, I decided to finish my Master’s degree abroad. It was then that I realized I did not need to abide by any certain planning for students and started preparing my English examinations. Actually I took GRE tests that summer and then got my TOEFL score last winter. I love the feeling of being free and taking control of my own life.</p> <p>Back to the topic of the chatacteristic about starting something entirely from scratch. From the perspective of relationship building, going abroad for study is sort of an entire new start for every one of us. Unlike those who choose to finish advanced degrees within SJTU hence benefiting from the relasionship built in undergraduate years, we need to neglect the sunk cost with courage when making decisions and enbrace a fresh new start.</p> <p>I remember the old days when I was in junior high reading the Harry Potter series where the main characters go through the Sorting Ceremony when the Sorting Hat decides the House(i.e. department) they belong to. Unlike the main characters, I wished I had been suited for Ravenclaw instead of Gryffindor because I kind of hoped for more intelligence(so as to perform better in school) and underestimated the significance of courage. Only with time went by did I realize that I was more of a Gryffindor than a Ravenclaw. Even though an abstract name cannot summarize what kind of person I am, at least I hope I will never lack the courage to start something new.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="essays"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[gaunion 2024 recruitment essay]]></summary></entry></feed>
