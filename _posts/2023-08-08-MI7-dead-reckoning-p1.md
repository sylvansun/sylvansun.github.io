### Spoiler Alert...

I went to see Tom Cruise's latest Mission Impossible series movie, Dead Reckoning(Part 1) as soon as it was released in China last month. The movie is worth watching for the action scenes alone, yet I was a little bit unsatisfied with their arrangement of Ilsa's ending. More precisely, I convinced myself to calm down with the hope of her death as an approach of deceiving the artificial intelligence. Should her death become a reality, I will definitely be furious.

Getting back to the point, when asked about your film-viewing experience about an MI series movie, one's impressions are typically classified into two categories: scene and plot. Considering that almost a month has passed since I watched the movie, the remaining memories are impressive and worth discussion.

## Plots

### The tightly knit MI trio

### Ilsa's ending

### The introduction of Peggy Carter to the crew

### The formidable AI

## Scenes

### You can always count on a speeding train

### Motorcycle ride off a cliff

### The *poisonous* gas bomb

You remember the explosion of an apparant poisonous bomb filling the conference room with horrifying green gas?
