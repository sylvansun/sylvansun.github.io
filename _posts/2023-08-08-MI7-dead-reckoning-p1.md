### Spoiler Alert

I went to see Tom Cruise's latest Mission Impossible series movie, Dead Reckoning(Part 1) as soon as it was released in China last month. The movie is worth watching for the action scenes alone, yet I was a little bit unsatisfied with their arrangement of Ilsa's ending. More precisely, I convinced myself to calm down with the hope of her death as an approach of deceiving the artificial intelligence. Should her death become a reality, I will definitely be furious.

Getting back to the point, when asked about your film-viewing experience about an MI series movie, one's impressions are typically classified into two categories: scene and plot. Considering that almost a month has passed since I watched the movie, the remaining memories are impressive and worth discussion.

## Plots

### The tightly knit MI trio

The footage is well distributed among the actors, with Ethan being the point man, Luther the reliable technician, and Benji the comic relief. The trio is a well-oiled machine, with each member playing their part to perfection. For me one of the most important driver that keeps me coming back to the theater over and over again is the chemistry between the three. I always treasure friendship and the interpretation of camaraderie in MI series is way better than that in other movies of the same genre(no offense).

Ever since they arranged the plot of Ethan saving Benji at the risk of giving huge amount of untracable money to Lane at the end of MI:5 and Ethan saving Luther with the danger of lossing the plutonium at the start of MI:6, I have known that no crisis can make them turn their backs on each other. Should there be any substitution of any single member of the team, I will not buy it. With this premise in mind, my doubt about Ilsa's ending arose quite naturally.

### Ilsa's ending(perhaps?)

Frankly speaking, I did not expect that Ilsa would die at all when Gabriel announced that one of Ilsa and Grace would be killed so that the chance of him acquiring the key would be the highest under the prediction of AI. After all, we are talking about the female agent who was capable of carrying out the task of undercover with Lane and slained Vinter alone, the Bone Doctor.

Itâ€™s not that I do not accept her death, it's just that I am not satisfied with the way it happened.

### The introduction of Peggy Carter to the crew

### The formidable AI

## Scenes

### You can always count on a speeding train

### Motorcycle ride off a cliff

### The *poisonous* gas bomb

You remember the explosion of an apparant poisonous bomb filling the conference room with horrifying green gas?
